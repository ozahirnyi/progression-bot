# ProgressionBot (Student Skeleton)

This repo is intentionally prepared as a **learning project**:
- Telegram transport + command routing are implemented.
- **Business logic is removed** and must be implemented by the student.

## What to read
- `tasks/task_00.md` (start here)

## Run
1) Create `.env` (see `.env.example`) and set `BOT_TOKEN`.
2) Install deps:

```powershell
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3) Start the bot:

```powershell
py -m progression_bot
```

## Secrets
Never commit `.env` (token).
