"""Domain rules (student-owned).

TODO(student):
- Determine day status rules:
  - workday schedule (Mon-Fri)
  - target minutes (2h)
  - bonus threshold (>=3h)
  - missed day definition (workday with 0 minutes after day passed)
  - how to treat today (not missed yet)
- Implement deadline projection logic:
  - remaining hours/minutes based on plan
  - projection based on planned future capacity (2h per workday)
- Implement streak logic (optional).
